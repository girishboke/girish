                <p class="lead-info">
                        Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) is considered to be one of history's greatest
                        military leaders. He rose to prominence during the French Revolution (1787–99) 
                        and served as emperor of France from 1804 to 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon 
                        is remembered today for his role in the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15), and his defeat 
                        at the battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. But how much do you know about him?
                </p>

                <h3>Here we bring you the facts about Napoleon Bonaparte and explain why he was 
                    exiled to the island of Elba in 1814…
                </h3>

                <h4>When was Napoleon Bonaparte born?</h4>
                <p>15 August 1769, in Corsica.</p>

                <h4>When did he die?</h4>
                <p>5 May 1821, on the Atlantic island of Saint Helena.</p>

                <h4>What is he remembered for?</h4>
                <p>Many things, but in particular his roles, which included Emperor of the French, 
                    during the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15), and his defeat at the battle of Waterloo
                    on 18 June 1815.
                </p>

                <h4>Who were his family?</h4>
                <p>Napoleon was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Maria Buonaparte
                    (1746–85), a lawyer, and Letizia Ramolino Buonaparte (1750–1836). The Buonapartes 
                    were minor Corsican nobility.
                </p>
                <p>Napoleon was twice married: to Joséphine de Beauharnais, from 1796–1810, and Marie 
                    Louise, [later known as the Duchess of Parma], from 1810–1821. His second wife bore
                    him a son, Napoleon II.
                </p>
                <p>Napoleon acknowledged one illegitimate son, Charles Léon (b 1806), but may have 
                    had further unacknowledged illegitimate offspring.
                </p>

                <h4>What was his childhood like?</h4>
                <p>Although Napoleon’s parents were members of minor Corsican nobility, the family
                    was not affluent. Educated at French military academies, which he attended on
                    scholarships, Napoleon was poor compared to his classmates, who came from wealthy,
                    well-connected families. Having grown up in Corsica, Napoleon’s first language was
                    Italian, not French, and he was teased for allegedly sounding like a peasant.
                </p>

                <h4>When did he begin his military career?</h4>
                <p>Aged 15, Napoleon was admitted to the elite École Militaire in Paris, but was forced to 
                    complete the two-year course in just one after his father died of stomach cancer, leaving
                    Napoleon as the family’s chief source of income. He became a commissioned officer just 
                    after his 16th birthday.
                </p>
                <p>As war was about to break out across Europe, 
                    <a href="https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/7-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-napoleonic-wars/">
                    Napoleon was still a second lieutenant stationed in a sleepy garrison town,
                    and went on leave to see his family in Corsica.</a>
                </p>

                <h4>What were Napoleon’s early achievements?</h4>
                <p>In July 1792 Napoleon was promoted to captain in the regular army, and in 1796,
                    having helped to suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary 
                    government in Paris, he was made commander of the French army in Italy.
                </p>
                <p>Napoleon’s national profile was bolstered dramatically by his numerous critical
                    victories against the Austrians and his marriage to Joséphine de Beauharnais, 
                    whose first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais, was famously guillotined during 
                    the Reign of Terror [a period of violence following the onset of the French 
                    Revolution].
                </p>
                <p>In November 1799, Napoleon became first consul, and worked to establish a 
                    European empire under his military dictatorship. He centralised the government,
                    reinstated Roman Catholicism as the state religion, instituted education reforms,
                    and managed the creation of the Bank of France.
                </p>


                <h4>When did he become emperor of France?</h4>
                <p>Napoleon triumphed over the Austrians at Marengo in 1800, and then negotiated a 
                    general European peace (which established French power on the continent). In 1802
                    Napoleon proclaimed himself consul for life, and two years later he became emperor
                    of France.
                </p>

                <h4>How did he gain control over Europe?</h4>
                <p>But the peace Napoleon had negotiated was short-lived – by 1803 Britain had 
                    resumed war with France, later joined by Russia and Austria.
                </p>
                <p>Britain’s naval victory at Trafalgar in 1805 forced Napoleon to abandon his
                    plans to invade England, and he turned his attention instead to Austro-Russian
                    forces, which he defeated at Austerlitz later that year in what is considered to
                    be one of his greatest victories.
                </p>
                <p>Napoleon gained much new territory in the years that followed, which seemingly
                    gave him control of Europe. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, and Napoleon’s
                    relatives and loyalists were installed as leaders in Italy, Naples, Spain and Sweden,
                    as well as Holland and Westphalia – territories newly created by Napoleon.
                </p>

                <h4>Why did Napoleon go into exile?</h4>
                <p>From 1810, the tide began to turn against Napoleon: France suffered several 
                    military defeats that drained resources, and in 1812 Napoleon oversaw the 
                    catastrophic failed invasion of Russia. France was forced to retreat, and of 
                    the original 400,000 frontline troops, fewer than 40,000 returned.
                </p>
                <p>Paris fell in March 1814, and Napoleon went into exile on the island of Elba, 
                    over which he was given sovereignty. Meanwhile, his wife and son went to 
                    Austria.
                </p>

                <h4>Why did he return to power?</h4>
                <p>But in February 1815, after less than a year in exile, Napoleon escaped from 
                    Elba and marched on the French capital, and victoriously returned to power. 
                    This prompted Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria to declare war. His success
                    was short-lived: he governed for a period now known as the Hundred Days – a brief
                    second reign brought to an end by the battle of Waterloo in June 1815.
                </p>

                <h4>When and where did Napoleon die?</h4>
                <p>Following his humiliating defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena,
                    where he died in 1821, aged 51, most likely from stomach cancer. Napoleon was buried 
                    on the island and his remains were not returned to France until 1840 – an event marked
                    by what <a href="https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/articles/the-death-of-napoleon-bonaparte-and-the-retour-des-cendres-french-and-british-perspectives/">
                    expert Fiona Parr describes as a “a level of splendour never before seen”</a>.
                </p>

                <h4>Where is Napoleon buried?</h4>
                <p>Napoleon’s remains are entombed in a crypt at Les Invalides in Paris, 
                    where other French military leaders are interred.
